a. What is an issue?

b. What is a pull request?
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

c. How do I open up a pull request?

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
The key difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is a free, open source version control tool that developers install locally on their personal computers, while GitHub is an online git repository hosting service built to run Git in the cloud. Git is a piece of software. GitHub is an online SaaS service.

f. What does git diff do?
The git diff command is often used along with git status and git log to analyze the current state of a Git repo.
The git diff command helps you see, compare, and understand changes in your project. You can use it in many different situations, e.g. to look at current changes in your working copy, past changes in commits, or even to compare branches.

g. What is the main branch?
The default branch is also the initial branch that Git checks out locally when someone clones the repository. Unless you specify a different branch, the default branch in a repository is the base branch for new pull requests and code commits. By default, GitHub names the default branch main in any new repository.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
It dependes.
If the changes are meant to be a follow-up commit after the inital commit, we can push the changes into main branch.
If there's a new feature being tested, and developed, then we should create a separate new branch, stage, commit and push change to that separate branch, instead of the main branch. When we are confident and ready to merge the new branch to the main branch, then we can create a pull request, then merge the two.
